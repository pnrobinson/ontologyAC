# ontologyAC
Ontology Autocomplete Widget


## Building
Note that I needed to activate Settings/Build/Runner/..delegate to maven to build in IntelliJ
mvn package should work

## Running
The app opens a window. Select the hp.json file. After it has loaded, the text field should do autocomplete.
Click on the lower button and the term id of the select term is printed to STDOUT
